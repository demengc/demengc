### ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

I'm Demeng, a curious student and software developer passionate about using technology to create real-world impact.

I previously led (and still maintain) Demeng Development, my personal brand where I built Minecraft plugins, Discord bots, and RESTful APIs. My open-source work has over 170,000 downloads and has served 1,000+ customers globally. I've also contributed to projects for brands and creators, ranging from advanced admin tools to immersive game modes, that garnered several million impressions per month.
